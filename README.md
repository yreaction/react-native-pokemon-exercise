# App for listing Pokémon monsters:

## Getting started:

The exercise is required to be done in **React Native**. Although it is not needed, we recommend you to use Expo (https://expo.io/learn) for this exercise. It will help you a lot on creating the project and test it quickly.

Once the exercise is finished please send it to us via link to a zipped file with all the project files. You can use Google Drive or any other sharing platforms.

## Instructions:

The purpose of the exercise is to create a simple app that basically lists all the monsters of Pokémon and displays some information.
There's no time limit to do the exercise but we estimated that it could take around 2 hours.

## Where to get the data:

The data can be fetched from PokeAPI, please check this documentation that contains all the needed information:
https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2

## Structure of the app:

The app should contain a list of scrollable items, each item should contain at least the pokemon's name and the sprite image.

When an item is pressed, it should show some info related to the pokemon, you can present any info you want, just be creative!

Regarding styling, there's no design for this so don't care too much about the styles. If it looks cool, the better, but it's not the purpose of the exercise.

_NOTE: There are no limitations regarding the use of external libraries, feel free to use whatever you want that makes sense with the exercise._

## Bonus points:

1. **Add a search bar:**

The purpose is to search pokemons by its name, unfortunately the API doesn't provide a way to search/filter the pokemons list so you have to figure out a creative solution.

2. **Add pokemon's cry sound:**

The purpose is to play a sound effect associated with each pokemon, the API doesn't provide an URL for this resource but you can check how https://pokemoncries.com/ are playing them.

Good luck and thanks for your time! :confetti_ball:
